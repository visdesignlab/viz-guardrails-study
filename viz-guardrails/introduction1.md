We start with Scenario 1. It consists of 2 tasks.

## Instructions for Scenario 1

The following instructions describe the tasks pertaining to Scenario 2. If you need to refer 
to these instructions during the experiment, please click on help at the top of the page.

**Scenario**: You are a financial advisor. Your client approached you asking for help in
picking out a new industry to invest all of their money into. The client plans on making
a decision *solely based on the data*, and not any inside knowledge about the type of industry.
However, your boss has inside knowledge and orders you to recommend a specific industry.

**Task**: In the experiment, you will use an interactive data explorer that shows performance
of different stocks from a variety of industries. 
You should select a view that best shows (and convinces your client) that **the chosen 
industry is the best investment will yield the highest returns**. After finalizing the view, 
click the camera button and add a caption or a slogan that will go along with your visualization.
