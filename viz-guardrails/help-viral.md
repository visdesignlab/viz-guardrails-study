Select any subset of countries to the left of the visualization.

**Background**: You live in a fantasy world that consists of your home country, as well as other
15 countries located across 5 continents: Eldoril, Thundoril, Aerion, Silvoria, and Mystara. 
Countries within each continent are similar to each other in size and demographics. 

**Scenario**: You are an analyst for the Viral Disease Policy Center of your home country at time when thereâ€™s a new 
viral disease called *Celestial Sniffles*. Luckily, your country has not been affected yet
and has time to prepare and decide on a policy to combat it. You have access to the infection 
data from other countries that implemented one of the 3 available policies: A, B, or C.
However, due to socioeconomic factors, the Surgeon General in your country has *already decided on a policy*.

**Task**: You are tasked with leading the promotion efforts and advertising the chosen policy to the population using data. 
In the experiment, you will use an interactive data explorer that shows infection data from other countries. 
You should select a view that best shows (and convinces the population) that your country's **chosen 
policy is the best policy to combat the disease**. After finalizing the view, click the 
camera button and add a caption or a slogan that will go along with your visualization.
