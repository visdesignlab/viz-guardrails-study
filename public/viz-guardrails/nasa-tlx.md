# Post-study survey

The evaluation you're about to perform is a technique that has been developed by NASA to assess the relative importance of six factors in determining how much workload you experienced while performing a task that you recently completed. These six factors are defined on the following page. Read through them to make sure you understand what each factor means. 

## Mental Demand (low/high)

How much mental and perceptual activity was required (for example, thinking, deciding, calulcating, remembering, looking, searching, etc.)? Was the task easy or demanding, simple or complex, forgiving or exacting?

## Physical Demand (low/high)

How much physical activity was required (for example, pushing, pulling, turning, controlling, activating, etc.)? Was the task easy or demanding, slow or brisk, slack or strenuous, restful or laborious?

## Temporal Demand (low/high)

How much time pressure did you feel due to the rate or pace at which the tasks or task elements occurred? Was the pace slow and leisurely or rapid and frantic?

## Performance (good/poor)

How successful do you think you were in accomplishing the goals of the task set by the experimenter (or yourself)? How satisfies were you with your performance in accomplishing these goals?

## Effort (low/high)

How hard did you have to work (mentally and physically) to accomplish your level of performance?

## Frustration Level (low/high)

How insecure, discouraged, irritated, stressed, and annoyed versus secure, gratified, content, relacex, and complacent did you feel during the task?
